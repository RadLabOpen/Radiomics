"HCC_adv_recur"

This collection of Python scripts implements the complete data processing and feature extraction pipeline for the research study titled "Radiomics-Based Prediction of Advanced-Stage Recurrence in Resected Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Gadoxetic Acid-Enhanced MRI". The primary objective of this workflow is to extract, process, and standardize quantitative radiomic features from pre-operative, multi-phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI scans. The resulting feature set is intended for use in developing machine learning models to predict post-resection tumor recurrence.
