# Radiomics


This page is for sharing the radiomics code for researchers and reviewers.

The code in the HCC_adv_recur folder implements the complete data processing and feature extraction pipeline for the research study titled "Radiomics-Based Prediction of Advanced-Stage Recurrence in Resected Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Gadoxetic Acid-Enhanced MRI." The primary objective of this workflow is to extract, process, and standardize quantitative radiomic features from pre-operative, multi-phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI scans. The resulting feature set is intended for use in developing predictive machine learning models.
